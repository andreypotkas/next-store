# Next Store

Welcome to Next Store! This is a project implemented using Next.js with TypeScript, utilizing the PrimeReact UI library and SCSS modules for beautiful user interfaces and Zustand for state management. In this project, I provide functionality for managing favorite and cart products, storing them locally using localStorage. For product data, I use a dummy API.

## Features

- **Next.js with TypeScript**: Utilize the power of Next.js for server-side rendering and TypeScript for type safety.
- **PrimeReact UI Library**: Design beautiful and responsive user interfaces with PrimeReact components.
- **Zustand State Management**: Manage state with ease using Zustand, a minimalist state management library.
- **Favorite Products**: Allow users to mark their favorite products.
